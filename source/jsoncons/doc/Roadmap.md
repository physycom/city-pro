# Roadmap

### For later releases

- Support pull parsing for cbor, msgpack, and CSV.

- Support more error recovery and introduce optional `lenient_error_handler`.

- Remove names that have been deprecated for more than a year.

At this point we'll slap a Version 1.0.0 Full Release stamp on `jsoncons`
(we've been leading up to this since 2013.)

### Post 1.0.0

- Support cbor keys implemented using SIDs

- Support [JSON Content Rules](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-newton-json-content-rules/) for schema validation in `jsoncons_ext`
